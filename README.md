# MongoDB-API-for-Social-Network-App
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
This project was developed to build and structure a social network API using MongoDB due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.
Users are able to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. 

This social network API uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, Mongoose ODM and the Moment JavaScript date library to format timestamps.  

Because this application's purpose is to showcase the building and structuring of a social network API, it isn't being deployed. Please take a look of the walkthrough video below that demonstrates its functionality.
